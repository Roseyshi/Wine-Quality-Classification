The aim of this project is to help wine manufacturers ro understand which compenents in the wines improve the quality of the wine. The dataset is puclicly available on Kaggle. There are 12 predictor variable sof the quality of one: type, fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur oxide, total sulfur oxide, density, pH, sulphates and alcohol. Quality in this case is our target variable. Not all predictor variables are important in determining the quality of the wine and so several feature selection techniques will be used to determine the important features. With important features identified, we will train and tune several models to identify which best predicts the quality of the wine.
